5. **Enter a prompt** in the text area or select a pre-defined sample prompt
6. **Click "Generate Response"** to see the model's output
7. **Review the parameter summary** shown below each response to understand what settings were used
8. **Experiment with different settings** to see how they affect the model's responses
9. **Expand the educational section** to learn more about each hyperparameter

## üß† Understanding Hyperparameters

The core educational value of this application is learning how different hyperparameters affect AI model outputs. Here's what each parameter does:

### Temperature (0.0 to 1.0)
Controls randomness and creativity in the model's responses:
- **Low values (0.1-0.4)**: More deterministic, focused, and predictable responses
- **Medium values (0.5-0.7)**: Balanced between creativity and coherence
- **High values (0.7-1.0)**: More creative, diverse, and sometimes surprising responses

*Best for*: Lower for factual tasks, higher for creative writing

### Top-p / Nucleus Sampling (0.0 to 1.0)
Controls diversity by considering the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the set value:
- **Low values (0.1-0.4)**: Considers only the most likely tokens, resulting in more focused text
- **Medium values (0.5-0.7)**: Balanced consideration of likely tokens
- **High values (0.7-0.9)**: Considers a wider range of tokens, introducing more diversity

*Best for*: Lower for precision tasks, higher for exploratory content

### Top-k (1 to 100)
Limits token selection to the top k most likely tokens at each step:
- **Low values (1-10)**: Very limited selection, more predictable output
- **Medium values (20-40)**: Balanced token selection
- **High values (50+)**: Wider range of token options, potentially more varied output

*Best for*: Lower for specific, controlled output, higher for creative tasks

### Token Limit (50 to 8192)
Sets the maximum length of the generated response in tokens (roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words per token):
- Shorter limits are useful for concise answers
- Longer limits allow for detailed explanations, stories, or code generation

*Best for*: Adjust based on how much content you want the model to generate

### Stop Sequences
Custom text patterns that will cause the model to stop generating when encountered:
- Useful for controlling output format
- Can specify multiple stop sequences (one per line)
- Common examples: "\n\n", "###", "END"

*Best for*: Creating structured outputs or preventing the model from continuing beyond a certain point

### Frequency Penalty (0.0 to 2.0)
Reduces repetition by penalizing tokens based on their frequency in the text so far:
- **0.0**: No penalty for repetition
- **0.5 - 1.0**: Moderate discouragement of repetition
- **1.5 - 2.0**: Strong discouragement of repetition

*Best for*: Reducing repetitive phrases or patterns in longer content

### Presence Penalty (0.0 to 2.0)
Reduces repetition by penalizing tokens that have appeared at all in the text so far:
- **0.0**: No penalty for using the same tokens again
- **0.5 - 1.0**: Moderate encouragement of new tokens
- **1.5 - 2.0**: Strong encouragement to use new tokens and concepts

*Best for*: Encouraging the model to explore new topics, ideas, or vocabulary
